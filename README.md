# CTRSnake
Snake for CTR (3ds).

Project for me to learn devkitpro and graphics shit

## Feature ideas
- Save and load high score from fs
- Display high score and score in bottom display
- Pause menu?
- Don''t auto move snake, let the user pick a direction to start
- Game Modes
  - bounds would not end game, would just move snake to opposite end. would need a new game mechanic that can cause a game over (ex spikes).
  - keep bounds, but add new game mechanics that can cause a game over (ex spikes).
- Settings
  - color editor - allow the user to style certain game elements, like food and snake
- Music
